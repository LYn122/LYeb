  I’m not here to talk about philosophy, I do not possess that clarity. But from the evolutionary aspect, I want to
  align some ideas from <i>The Art of Focus</i> by Dan Koe with this article <i>The Neuroscience of Happiness and
    Pleasure</i> that
  I’m reading today.
  <br><br>
  We’re not jelled, we’re craving for meanings; We’re not set, we’re facing our dread of death. We possess
  consciousness, which is why we’re not merely driven by the rewards of survival and procreation — we feel the need to
  preserve our mental and conscious selves even more intensely than our physical existence. We attempt to replicate our
  consciousness—or rather, our concepts of self — and we constantly predict and anticipate the outcomes of our choices
  and actions based on conscious experience tied to evolutionary rewards.
  <br><br>
  According to the article, Charles Darwin’s pioneering idea suggests that the evolution of emotions and affective
  expressions are adaptive responses to environmental situations, indicating the evolutionary functions of both positive
  and negative affect.
  <br><br>
  One way to understand this is through the lens of the dopamine reward system: When a rabbit sees a bush with ripe
  berries, and likewise when a lion sees that rabbit, their dopamine systems start to activate and bring positive
  effects to the brain. Over time, evolution has created a strong connection between food cues and rewards, leading
  animals to act more eagerly when they detect food.
  <br><br>
  This mechanism works for all mammals, including our species. However, as I mentioned before, we possess that “tragic
  miracle of consciousness,” which makes things drastically different. When our ancestors saw a bush with berries, their
  dopamine system signaled the reward too; they felt activated and excited just like that rabbit and that lion. But the
  crucial difference is that they experienced it in a conscious way, logging the berries into their minds as a potential
  survival tool instead of just berries, and they began to invest their attention in it. They started to make plans to
  consciously regulate these rewards and pleasures, using that positive energy to visualize the future in order to have
  more rewards and to have a system to invest their mental energy and attention. They framed their clarity of goals and
  solved the hierarchy of problems. A mindful plan and realistic thinking pattern are crucial. Just like evolution
  created a strong link between food cues and pleasure, positive affect/pleasure/energy can be linked with experiences
  and thinking patterns/systems through visualization — by focusing your positive energy toward a positive outcome based
  on prior rewards and the systems you used to manage those rewards.
  <br><br>
  Back to our ancestors standing next to that bush, they wonder: which choice and action is better? To keep the berries
  and set a rabbit trap near the bush, or just collect all of the berries? Even if collecting the berries is better, how
  many should I take? If I take too much, would it rot before my community can consume it? But if I leave it in the
  bush, does that not mean I risk it being taken by another tribe, eaten by the rabbit, or next time I come to the bush,
  there is a lion hiding inside and I become its prey? Or can I replicate the berries in a beautiful, safe, and warm
  valley so I can have thousands of them next year?
  <br><br>
  You see, it’s about paying attention to the potential survival tools; consciously and mindfully thinking, planning,
  and making predictions for your actions and choices; deriving value or utility from these; and finally, creating the
  future landscape.
  <br><br>
  This is one of our evolutionary advantages: the human ability to consciously predict and anticipate the outcome of our
  choices and actions—a double-edged sword of our nature. Our habit-loving brain has already adapted this since the
  magical “Cognitive Revolution”. So, when it comes to survival, we just love to make plans and anticipate. But here
  come the problems, especially in modern society: physical survival is no longer a huge problem for the vast majority
  of Earth’s residents, and the material enjoyment most people experience is much better than that of ancient gatherers.
  On the contrary, however, we can say that the mental lives of modern generations is still living in the “crisis horn”
  of Africa, much more chaotic and dangerous than the one our ancestors once resided in, where predators lurked
  everywhere, and Homo sapiens sapiens could only survive through their creative intelligence.
  <br><br>
  Survival, under this context, is no longer in terms of solely collecting water and food to maintain vital signs; but
  involves being financially capable of maintaining a certain quality of life, which has a strong connection with your
  mental survival needs. That’s why the survival tools people nowadays pay attention to are those that bring them an
  income, allowing them to live a qualitative life and, at the same time, provide them with cognitive value and utility.
  <br><br>
  We can’t escape this habit of seeking potential “survival” tools. The need to sustain our conscious selves makes us
  set goals, anticipate future rewards, and make plans, find the value, exactly like our bush-ancestors did. But social
  entities and their default life paths come into people’s vision far earlier in life, before they even have a chance to
  think independently. As a result, they attach to these “bushes,” setting them as the ultimate goals of life and
  following that default path, paying most of their attention to it without ever changing. Why? Because it is easy; it
  reduces the pain of facing uncertainty and the hard process of finding the real tools that fit our genuine interests.
  In the past, our ancestors had to face the uncertainty of nature. Nowadays, it seems you can make choices and take
  action while only paying a small mental tax to the universe, as that promised future makes the prediction and
  anticipation of your choices much easier to make—they become no-brainers. And you don’t even need to put in any
  endeavor to derive value and utility from those bushes, as it is already fixed by others — stagnant and assembly-made,
  placed on grocery shelves waiting for you to take. The price is being paid by allowing the fake, other-made conceptual
  ‘self’ to be implanted in your mind when you follow those default paths; so you can continue enjoying those spoon-fed
  pleasures, consciously or unconsciously suppressing the real opportunities around you for the next level of awareness,
  and indulge in your fragile fantasy of the future landscape.
  <br><br>
  The natural, universal rule of entropy is permanent from the physical plane to the mental plane: the future will never
  be certain. Entropy keeps increasing the chaos, and we must invest our efforts and attention in our real lives to
  counteract it and find our balance. This mental system of misaligned goals, certainty, and easy work is like a bubble
  that ought to be broken. Unfortunately, when it breaks, your expectations will have already strayed too far from
  reality, and the gap between these two is where depression comes in, creating a black hole that aims to drain every
  passion you have for this life, robbing you of the most valuable gift given to humanity: the ability to appreciate the
  present.
  <br><br>
  P.S. Anyway, it’s only a narrow cause-effect analysis, but evolutionary reasons are interesting to me, and these
  problems truly exist.
  <br><br>
  In conclusion, it works like this: you feel the need to survive your conscious self. You do not want to be a victim of
  mental entropy, so you need a system to invest your attention and mental energy. But in the third millennium, a real
  potential survival tool for mental life is not like berries on a bush, just sitting there waiting for someone to grab
  it; the future is always uncertain. A mental survival pattern can only be built when you consciously gain knowledge
  and engage in trial and error in your own life—a self-experiment process, the experiences, and the will to keep
  zooming out and continue expanding the “infinite masterpiece” of this game. Then you can build a powerful link between
  your positive energy and your experience, along with ever-improving thinking patterns, through visualization. In order
  to achieve this, you need radical open-mindedness instead of a radical ideology; you need to stop labeling yourself.
  Also, you need to avoid any too-much-certainty goals that lead to overimagination. You need to align expectations with
  reality, then act.
