  I feel lonely right now, proabably because I only slept maybe 2h last night, triggered the fire alarm and so a little
  bit neurasthenia? People don’t really talk with me, it’s just a superficial kindly conversation and relationship:
  they
  don’t hate me and
  their upbringing make them talk with me in a polite way.<br>
  But I guess I also feel like I don’t really need to have a real friendship, relationship and so on. That would be
  a
  gift, if happens to my life, even though it would bring me a sense of unsecure because I know if someone truly
  entered
  my hearts, losing them probably will kill me. I don’t really think I have a real friend so far in all periods of
  my
  life.
  <br><br>
  But I think now I feel fufilling with my
  focus on myself. For now, I just don’t depend emotionally on others and don’t need a relationship for self-worth.
  Honestly, I don’t even miss my family that much. It sounds cold, but I just want to focus on meaningful goals—my
  creations, growth, strength, and power.
  <br><br>
  I once shared a quote on social media from a great writer (I forget the name) who said that when we abstractly
  love
  humanity, we’re actually trying to love ourselves. I tear up at masterpieces created by humankind. The
  Civilization.
  I
  love our
  species, I value
  my intelligence, and that’s what I truly appreciate about life. I just love to be the glitch, the deviation in
  this
  human-made Matrix.
  <br><br>
  So who is the weirdo in the corner today? What are they paying attention to? What is fringey?

      I saw those pamphlets today, it named <i>Fox Cry Review</i>, I took one of them, and on the cover were two ceramic
      swans soaking unattended in a pool. The colors on them had long since blurred, and their once beautiful white
      feathers
      were covered in stains and limescale. It's a booklet that was printed and edited nine years ago. It still looks as
      good as new when you turn it over, but in six months' time it and the other years' compilations would be as
      dormant as this small campus that
      was
      about to be shut down, and I didn't want to see them discarded in a landfill, but even if I, or anyone else, took
      it
      away and remembered it, or if my overly idealistic idea of re-editing another Fox Cry Review after nine years
      became
      a
      reality—which is unlikely—what could any of this change? Its editors, the creators of the
      included works might remember them at some
      sporadic times, and I wonder where these creators are now, this volume is so new and light, yet the curse of
      oblivion
      is
      so heavy and lingering.

  <p>Lives are so fragile. I guess there's no meaning, only sparks of beautiful moments and peace. Reside your heart in
    the void and the present; it's the time you're looking at the sky at night and wondering where the truth lies. Feel
    no pain, yet no happiness. You stand there as it is—you are the creation of this universe, and the only absolute is
    this cycle of destruction and reunion. So I think we all come back together after it all. We unite, we evolve, we
    cross time and space—by love, in dignity. May those who forever sleep in the fire rest in their peace.<br>
    Grandma, I miss you so much, but now I'm not afraid of death anymore. I know we will return to each other again, no
    matter when or in which form. I'm sorry, I love you forever, and I have already grown into the person who has the
    courage to face my love and my heart.<br>
  </p>
