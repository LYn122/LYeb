    Develop the brain to create thinking channels and knowledge systems. As the brain builds and structures a web of
    thoughts and theories, the pain of existence simply disappears.
    <br>><br>
    People usually signs with emotions and feelings when they're eating, cuz eating is an ascending process, which makes
    people feel safe. Everything has a destination and you don't need to think much about it, just eat and enjoy. These
    emotions wouldn't appear at neither state of hunger and satisfaction.
    So when you are hungry, you think and hunt, therefore you create. When you start to eat, you feel your emotions and
    heart, and probably find an inner peace also learn about the origin of the love, throughout the process. And the
    time
    you fulfilled all of your appetite, you whether be humble and wait until you get hungry again or you die for your
    ignorance and arrogance.
    <br>><br>
    Nowadays it is much easier for people to create unhappiness or 'fake happiness' , look at those apartments, there
    are
    like thousands of little cages. I can't even imagine another way for people to find peace and authenticity except
    having a 'mental practice' and makes it a lifelong train. Believe me, cuz the past three years of my life, I
    suffered
    so much, trynna to add those general definitions and values of the
    modern society to myself, thought that I would be safe under some name and I would feel less alone and lost by
    define
    things like future career, dream schools…No. Those are fantasies ought to be demolished, but the people can't see
    through it disguised or they choose to ignore the fact. The first step is stop define yourself by using those
    societal
    slogans, and think independently. Just focus and find the real power. There's too many pains to suffer, and this is
    so
    far the only feasible way I find. It is actually that obvious, if we use the first principle and the logic to
    understand our mentality, but it is also too hard to seek, cuz emotions always overwhelm ourselves at the very first
    time. Therefore we have to learn how to swim at the same time we are drawing. Yep
    There's multiple ways to acquire dopamines, but there's a drastic difference between addiction and action. We need
    to
    learn how to focus and keep our minds sharp, and never try to use the old ways to define ourselves. Cuz comparing to
    the past, the physical world has changed relatively, but the mental world has changed entirely. And when you added
    definitions on yourselves, you will only facing the competitions and endless anxieties. You might be able to become
    successful but I can't see much point of spending so many times just because the desires to the so called 'success'.
    (It is even sth simply just about possibility, cuz those people don't even have a true mindset and a system to view
    the world, and they will never changed the world. )
    <br><br>
    Those jobs and 'successful achievements' can be done by anyone who is willing to learn and with the basic logic that
    a
    normal human would have(if the have the opportunities and haven't being brainwashed by the school.Sometimes even if
    the did, this theory still applies cuz those people have a really good resilience and doesn't know what is dignity,
    they can done those no-brainer yet need to spent a lot of times and efforts on.)
    But creation, is sth that need a great intellect to complete. Even everything has no meaning in the end of the time,
    but remember the words of Descartes. We think, therefore we are. It's about building the mind and focusing, and to
    notice that our consciousness(wisdoms, logics, insights, creations, the ability of focusing and structuring…)is the
    most valuable gift that had been given to us, from the logical plane, isn't it obvious that we have to live with it,
    the most precious treasure of us, instead of living by following those lust and desires of the animal world? They
    brings the chemical reactions, and left nothing to our souls except a feeling of being lost. It's interesting and
    ironic that we all have an instinct inside, which is the addiction of suffering. Some believe that there's a god who
    had suffered for us…alright, Stop at this point, I should read and receive more theories before discussing that. The
    deeper insights need much more time to discover, view those works that had been done by others would increase the
    efficiency so I can go much further.

    <b>Aug 3th Sat</b><br>
    The reason why we aways be confused by those questions about whether there's a fate and god, is that we can't
    understand the possibilities. We found out that things happened with a reason through our observations—If now one
    had ever planted a seed in the soil, there's no crops would grow. But a lot of things seemed purely happened
    randomly. Why the result of the evolution is the humanity? That contains too much variables and changes in the
    probabilities which already make it something out of the boundary of our cognition, so it became things randomly,
    for from our aspect it is something we can't explain using purely science and logics. We also understands we made
    our decisions by feeling our intuitions, feels like we are not the manipulator of every thought and the actions of
    ourselves. The things happened inside of our subconscious mind provides uncertainties which would make us afraid and
    panic, so we rather just believe that there's a superior consciousness, the so called god, is manipulating the
    history and already designed every stages of the 'fate' of everyone and the humanity as a whole.
    <br><br>
    And the fact is also that all we do is change the probabilities to '1'(in our definition, from rules that might be
    more fragile than we thought). If all we can see is the projection of the 'outside' worlds in our dark cave, how
    could we possibly know the fact, or even if we have a chance to ask a question, we wouldn't know how to ask and we
    can't understand the answer given by the 'god'.
    <br><br>
    Or discussing about these issues, this behavior itself is already absurd enough. How can a bunch of ants understand
    the principle of a computer?
    <br><br>
    That's too complex to us, even just try to think the most surface part, and it feels bad, like you are touching a
    fire wall.
    <br><br>
    By the way, those discussions about android are really interesting. At least this landscape can be possibly
    achieved, and we can witness the answer of the famous question. Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep?
    <br><br>
    Explained the relationship between our intelligence and consciousness, and if there's a pure love and morality which
    doesn't come from our demands in the animal worlds. To find our if it not those chemical reactions inside of brain
    but the purely intelligence, do 'we' still have the imagination in sleep and the incentives to explore when looking
    at the universe and the stars shining inside our eyes?
    <br><br>
    But a disappointed possible phenomenon can be that there are just too good at simulating human emotions. Therefore
    we really need to understand us much deeper, to touch the limitations, so at the day that we might truly facing
    another also much more famous question—To be, or not to be? At least we tried, and we've thought about ourselves
    <br><br>
    I guess this note is chaotic, perhaps reconsidering questions which is deep like those before I have building more
    webs and experiencing more.
    <br>><br>
    I need to feed my brain, it's not about the content, most of the knowledge itself, it's because I enjoy thinking and
    connecting, and I know at certain points I would enter into the next level of life. Real life (just like 4 years ago
    I first heard about it),past and our future, our life and our death, and our existence.

    <b>Source:an interview with contemporary artist Wendy White</b><br>
    “I find it really depressing that social media is making us wanna be more like everyone, instead of stand out.
    <br><br>
    -Or they are actually so thinking about how to stand out, and then they start to copying like those already standing
    out.
    <br><br>
    Oh yeah, there are that too.
    <br><br>
    -Like in the past, we used our gears and outfit to express our affliction to certain cultural phenomena and things.
    Nowadays, we try so hard to convey the message that we're so independent and disassociate with those. But at the
    mean time, when you're like swiping through the videos, shorts, everything. The algorithm actually put a tag on you.
    <br><br>
    Well, the algorithm seeks to homogenize everything. As society homogenizes, I mean, art is becoming the same. I
    mean, we basically live in a 'low risk' society in which people don't wanna take any chances that they might not be
    able to capitalize on. But sadly we are here for a very short time, and we should be who we are , find who we are,
    and just lean into it before everybody has the exact same teeth and bone structure, umm…and everyone's been face
    tuned , and art is all square and photo realism.
    <br><br>
    -Laughing
    <br><br>
    Because it's coming. And yeah, I mean, I know it's happening, but the funny thing is just I don't care. And I just
    keep doing my own thing anyway . And sometimes I stop and think like, huh, like I've made a lot of different bodies
    of work, I could have kept doing that for a longer, but I can't, because I'm alive in this moment. And right now
    this moment I need to make clear paintings. And that just the kind of artist I am and the kind of person I am. So
    I'm just sort of ruthless, in that going toward what I like and what I wanna see.
    <br><br>
    ...
    <br><br>
    -...and the she's kind of suck in that aesthetic.
    <br><br>
    Yeah, but you're in control of getting yourself out too. I mean, I'm not saying you should like, to up against the
    algorithm, cuz that's a waste of everyone's time, I think. We just have to find ways to carve out more individual
    space. And that's why art is so important, increasingly important. And that's why risk is so important , and I don't
    wanna keep harping on that, but the low risk thing is really pervasive in all parts of our culture now. Because
    things are so expensive, nobody wants to like, take a chance, take a risk. It's kind of a rough time.”

    “Become undefinable.<br>
    Run a marathon one day, write an essay the next. Direct a short film, build an app, deadlift 500lbs, strategize a
    marketing campaign, or do whatever your curiosity draws you to.<br>
    If you can be defined as '____', you face either competition or replacement.”

    <br><br>
    That's like a simple and water down ideal contained in this saying:<br>
    “凡所有相，皆是虚妄。”/btw that's Buddhism
    <br><br>
    Contains magnificent wisdoms, yet uses so short words.
    <br><br>
    开悟的核心即为不着相，以局外人的身份入世。
    <br><br>
    Labels, values and mindset, informations, you feel like they're affecting you, but the fact is that you are the one
    who controls them.
    <br><br>
    Subject and the object
    <br><br>
    So, To myself: The next time you feel like that you can't stop thinking about those deep philosophical questions,
    delve into the thoughts lies in the Taoism. The science of how this universe works./and us included, since we are
    part of it
    <br><br>
    “心外无一物，凡人可自渡” mortal/ conscious
    <br><br>
    Just about focusing on yourself and your thoughts, train your brain and cultivate your mental field. Instead of
    using the outside labels and concepts which have already been homogenized by the algorithms, to define yourself.
    <br><br>
    This behavior is anti natural, cause it messed up the right sequences of subject and the objects, also violating the
    complexity of the humanity, killing the true personality. Unfortunately, it has already became a habituated mindset
    subconsciously happened in most people's lives.
    <br><br>
    Also, reveals that keep being emotional and delve into the vortex of memories which bring harmful feelings, only
    brings us endless pains and sufferings.
    Interesting is that we can easily have this addiction of mental illnesses, the pain. But why?
    <br><br>
    Complexity comes again. Be patient, and wait for the great and beautiful moments of another little enlightenment.
    <br><br>
    The present goal is to finish the math study.

    Clever—sensitive “心智”
    <br><br>
    A Sensitive mind lead to anxious and would waste a lot of energy, brings the feeling of desperation.
    <br><br>
    Only if you turn a clever mind into a container of the true wisdom, you owns the power and live in a real life, a
    real world.
    <br><br>
    Sensitive yet remain firm, so the insights emerge

    <b>Aug 22nd Thu</b>
    &nbsp;/the day I became a legal adult
    <br>
    So, I'm at the plane to Paris right now.
    To be honest, I have no idea about how to describe my feelings, it's felt drastically different when witness things
    in the real life than to see things on the internet.
    <br><br>
    The power of authenticity, isn't it?
    One thing which I'm pretty sured about right now is that I do not feel scared.
